## Project

**pandavas** is a multi-agent system that autonomously resolves a single coding
task (bug fix or feature) on a repository the user already has locally. Research →
Worker → Test → Judge, coordinated by an Orchestrator, looping until the change
passes the gate (tests pass **and** judge approves) or it honestly reports it
could not. Full design: `docs/SPEC.md`.

## Agent → Brother map

| Role             | Brother      |
|------------------|--------------|
| Orchestrator     | Yudhishthira |
| Research         | Nakula       |
| Worker / Draft   | Arjuna       |
| Test (execution) | Bhima        |
| Judge / QA       | Sahadeva     |

The test runner (Bhima) is **deterministic — not an LLM.** Do not implement it as
an agent.

## SCOPE LOCK — read before writing anything

- **P0 / v0 is COMPLETE** (see `docs/SPEC.md` §10): deterministic executor,
  LangGraph orchestrator loop wired to stub agents, CLI, and one trivial bug
  fixed end-to-end on a local repo.
- **P1 is COMPLETE:** real **Nakula** (research + anchored typed brief +
  deterministic resolve gate), real **Arjuna** (worker + path-safe edits), and a
  real verification loop end-to-end. The **Judge (Sahadeva) is still a stub.**
- **P2 is COMPLETE:** real **Sahadeva** judge (diff + results vs
  acceptance_criteria, adequacy check, anchored feedback), **regression-aware
  Bhima** (baseline run, pytest-first JUnit XML, exit-code fallback),
  **oscillation detection**, and **best-attempt restore** at the cap.
- **P3 is COMPLETE** (scope lock lifted by explicit instruction):
  - **CLI/UX**: run report, offline wiring check, JSON report + per-iteration
    trace, clean error handling, token-usage reporting.
  - **Client docs**: README + LICENSE.
  - **Git delivery**: a converged change is committed to a new branch.
  - **Per-test rigor for any framework** via `--junit-xml` (universal JUnit XML);
    pytest auto-captured.
  - **Red→green surfacing** (`newly_passing`), **restore deletion-handling**
    (strays removed on restore), **LLM retry/backoff**, **CI** (GitHub Actions).
- **Quality posture:** keep the suite green (`python -m pytest`), keep CLI stdout
  ASCII-only (Windows-first), no hardcoded paths, real `.env` never committed.

## Possible future work (ask before starting)

- Deeper reproducibility hardening (persisted run manifests, seed pinning).
- Pre-fix RED isolation (run a new repro test against original code to prove it
  was genuinely red before the fix, beyond the baseline-vs-final signal).
- Multi-repo / batch runs; richer cost controls.

Do not start by polishing agent prompts. Prove each piece end-to-end before
moving to the next.

## House rules

- **No hardcoded machine paths.** No `D:\...`, no `C:\Users\...`. Use relative
  paths and config. This repo is public and others will clone it.
- **Secrets:** never commit a real `.env`. `.env.example` is the only env file in
  the repo; the real `.env` is gitignored.
- **No invention.** If a design point isn't in `docs/SPEC.md`, it isn't decided —
  ask, or mark `TODO`. Do not fill gaps with guesses.
- **Tests are ground truth.** Don't replace test execution with an LLM judgment.
- **Pin model strings** (never `"latest"`) and keep temperature ~0 for the
  agents, per `docs/SPEC.md` §8.
- **Honest failure over fake success.** If the loop can't converge, report it;
  never dress a failing result as a pass.

## Documents

- `docs/SPEC.md` — source of truth (design).
- `README.md` — public/client-facing overview.
- `docs/HANDOVER.template.md` — copy to `HANDOVER.md` during a long session,
  fill it, and **delete it** after the next session reads it.
- `MEMORY.md` — **auto-managed by Claude Code.** Do not hand-create it.
- `soul.md`, `.claude/hooks/` — added manually by the user later. **Do not create
  them.**
